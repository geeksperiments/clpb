CLP(B) is now included in SWI-Prolog as
[library(clpb)](http://www.swi-prolog.org/man/clpb.html).

Please see http://www.github.com/SWI-Prolog for the latest version.




This repository is still useful to keep track of test cases and usage
examples for the library.

There is also a limited alternative version using ZDDs. Please see the
[zdd](zdd) directory for more information. Try the ZDD-based version
for tasks where the BDD-based version runs out of memory. You must use
`zdd_set_vars/1` before using `sat/1` though.
